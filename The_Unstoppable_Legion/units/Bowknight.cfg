unit_description= _ "Rare though archers on horseback are, rarer still are experienced archers of this kind. The few archers who prove themselves in combat are given the title of bowknights, and their rarity often means that they are underestimated by their opponents. They are fearsome masters of hit-and-run attacks, but they can often overrun larger forces with hails of arrows before their opponents even have the chance the strike back. However, they remain vulnerable to return fire from archers, and prefer to leave them to charging units."
