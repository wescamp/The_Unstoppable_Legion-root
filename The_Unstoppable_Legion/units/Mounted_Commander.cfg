unit_description= _ "Inexperienced riders from Noble families are often viewed with distrust by fellow cavalry, percevied as having bought their way into the military. However, those nobles who prove themselves in combat swiftly earn the respect of other soldiers, and are given the rank of commander. They have the responsibility of leading mounted divisions into combat, and their expertise in military training makes their surrounding units all the more fearsome. They are also formidable in combat, although no sensible commander puts themselves in undue danger, as the loss of the commander usually loses the battle."
