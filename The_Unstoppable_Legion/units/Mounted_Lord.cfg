unit_description= _ "Some mounted nobles, once they achieve the status of commander, use their expertise to direct others into combat but cease to take part in combat themselves. However, any true commander continues to do their fair share in combat. Commanders who continue to prove their worth in combat are eventually recognised as Mounted Lords. They are very strong in meelee combat, and also a force to be reckoned with in ranged combat, but their greatest strength is their commanding skill, for units surrounding a Mounted Lord can easily decimate opponents of considerable standing."
