	unit_description= _ "According to pagan legend, in ancient times the guardians of the natural world were known as the Circle of Druids, said to be the most powerful druids the world had ever seen. Although lacking the agility of their elven counterparts, they still mastered the faerie arts of their elven counterparts with the greatest of ease. It was believed that the lack of sightings was because few enemies who saw them lived to tell the tale.

However, stories of the Great Druids have become far less frequent and less reliable as the generations passed by. As such, few now believe any Great Druids exist any more, let alone a Circle of Druids.
