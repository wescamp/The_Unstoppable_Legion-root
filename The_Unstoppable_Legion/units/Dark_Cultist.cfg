	unit_description= _ "Those who join legions of darkness without military or magical experience join the ranks of the cultists. Their usual task is to spread the word of their leaders, seeking those tempted by power and punishing those who reject their message. However, they will also fight in battles, and their lack of both magic and swordsmanship is compensated by their willingness to engage in suicidal but deadly attacks. Their favourite tactic is to burst through enemy ranks and kill whoever they are protecting, be it wounded comrades or defenceless civilians."
