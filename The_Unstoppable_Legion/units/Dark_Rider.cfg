	unit_description= _ "The few soldiers who join the dark legions with skills of fighting on horseback are often drawn into the ranks of the Dark Riders. Trained to greater standards than the rank and file units, they ride at breakneck speed and attack with inhuman ferocity. As such, many question whether the rider can still be considered human or their steeds can be considered as horses. Dark Riders are greatly feared, not so much because of their prowess in combat, but because their use is often to outrun and slaughter the weak and defenceless trying to flee the battle."
