unit_description= _ "One perpetual problem faced by Bowriders and Bowknights is that certain enemies position themselves in strong defensive positions, and an enemy archer in cover can be very difficult to take down. To counter this, some experienced bowknights concentrate their efforts on sharpshooting. They are not quite so good at hit-and-run attacks on open ground that Elite Bowknights excel at, but they are very effective at taking out heavily fortified enemies that are so often the bane of border patrols."
