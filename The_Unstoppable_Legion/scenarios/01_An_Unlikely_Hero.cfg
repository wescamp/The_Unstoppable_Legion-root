# Scenario Introduction

[story]

	story= _ "Welcome to The Unstoppable Legion. This is a work in progress, with currently 9 playable scenarios. Be aware that tactics in this campaign differ from the mainline campaigns. It is a standalone campaign, but for the full experience, you should also download 'Ye Newe Melodies Music' from the server."
	[/part]
	[part]
	music=main_menu.ogg
	story= _ "In the land of Suveran, where few men of Wesnoth have ever set foot, men spoke in fear of the invasion of Zharagorn, centuries ago."
	background=story/intro1.jpg
	[/part]
	[part]
	story= _ "In the dim and distant past, King Eldrian decreed that his eldest son, Wolfgang, was not suitable to succeed him to the throne. Surprised and angry, Wolfgang departed the kingdom, looking for a way to prove his worth. For months he travelled the land, until one day, whilst exploring the World's End mountains, as far north as anyone had ever mapped, he was drawn to a mysterious cave."
	background=story/intro1.jpg
	[/part]
	[part]
	story= _ "There, he found a crystal, known as the Black Emerald, that granted him unimaginable power. Prince Wolfgang renamed himself Zharagorn, and from miles around, people who craved power flocked to his leadership. Even the dead, fallen mercenaries from ages past with dreams of fortune and glory, rose to serve him. Soon he had a legion like nothing the world had ever seen."
	background=story/intro1.jpg
	[/part]
	[part]
	story= _ "So legend says, when his legion started marching south, nothing could stop him. Dwarven and Elvish kingdoms, Orcish clans and city-states in his path fell one by one. Zharagorn was merciful to those who surrendered, allowing them to live on as slaves. Those who resisted were slaughtered."
	background=story/intro1.jpg
	[/part]
	[part]
	story= _ "Only the Circle of Druids came anywhere close to stopping him. They sneaked behind enemy lines and sought to destroy the Black Emerald, still in the cave where Wolfgang discovered it. But before they could make it, Zharagorn himself tracked them down, and the Darkguard, the elite of his army, wiped them out."
	background=story/intro1.jpg
	[/part]
	[part]
	story= _ "Finally, Zharagorn's forces reached Karasov, the capital city. It is said that King Eldrian's forces held out a remarkable three days before they realised they were no match for Zharagorn's, then the King himself rode to meet his son to give whatever he wanted."
	background=story/intro1.jpg
	[/part]
	[part]
	story= _ "Zharagorn's demands were strange. All he asked was for his father to admit he was wrong to refuse him the throne, and to build a temple to his greatness. And although the generations who tell the story find it strange, when King Eldrian agreed to this request, Zharagorn's forces withdrew, never to be seen again."
	background=story/intro1.jpg
	[/part]
	[part]
	story= _ "That was a long time ago ... But the temple still stood as the centuries went by. No-one dared to desecrate it, fearing that it would lead to his return. And there were the cultists: men who prayed for Zharagorn's return, who worshipped in the temple every day."
	background=story/intro1.jpg
	[/part]
	[part]
	story= _ "Of course, legends are just legends, and eventually some started to question how reliable the story really was. Indeed, many started to believe it was nothing more than superstitious tittle-tattle. Then one day, Zharagorn returned, and a new legend was made. But this time, the legend was of a young man named Viktor ... and how he stood up to the unstoppable legion."
